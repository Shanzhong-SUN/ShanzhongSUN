### About me

I graduated from [Chern Institute of Mathematics](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn), Nankai University, Tianjin and got my PhD degree in 2001.

I spent two years from 2001 to 2003 at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University as postdoc.

Then I joined Capital Normal University in 2003 as a faculty member of Department of Mathematics.

Here is my CV (to be added).

### [Research](https://shanzhong-sun.github.io/ShanzhongSUN/research)


My research interests lie at the crossroads of mathematics and physics, and I work on such topics as N-body problem in celestial mechanics, Fukaya category in symplectic topology, semiclassical trace formula and resurgence theory. 

More precisely, I am interested in 

* Symplectic Geometry and Symplectic Topology: symmetry and symplectic reduction; Floer homologies and Fukaya categories; quiver varieties; cluster varieties; singularities from symplectic perspective; symplectic nature of moduli spaces (e.g. Hitchin moduli space); noncommutative symplectic/Poisson geometry; derived symplectic/Poisson geometry; 

* Hamiltonian Systems and Celestial Mechanics: Lagrangian Grassmannian and Maslov index; N-body problem (stability; central configurations; periodic orbits); Gutzwiller’s semiclassical trace formula and quantum chaos; (algebraic) completely integrable Hamiltonian systems (ACIS) and their interactions with geometry and physics
 
* Mathematical Physics: higher structures (homological/homotopical algebras, higher categories,...) behind quantum mechanics and quantum field theory; quantization (semiclassical, deformation quantization, BV, brane quantization...); Feynman diagrams; modular objects; gauge theory;
  
* Resurgence Theory and Mould Calculus à la Écalle with applications in mathematics (BCH, MZV, modularity...) and quantum physics (wall-crossing, Écalle-Voros exact WKB analysis, complex Chern-Simons theory, topological string theory...)

    > 题目：GIT quotients and symmetric periodic orbits 
    > 
    > 摘要：This is joint work with Agustin Moreno and Dayung Koh. The restricted three-body problem is invariant under various antisymplectic involutions. These real structures give rise to the notion of symmetric periodic orbit which simultaneously have an open string interpretation as a Hamiltonian chord as well as a closed string interpretation as a periodic orbit. This makes the bifurcation analysis of symmetric periodic orbits very intriguing since under bifurcations two local Floer homologies are invariant, the periodic one as well as the Lagrangian one. In this talk I explain how methods from symmetric space theory can help to extract efficient datas from reduced monodromy matrices of periodic orbits helping to analyse the possible bifurcation patterns.
