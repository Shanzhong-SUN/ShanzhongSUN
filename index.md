### About me

I graduated from [Chern Institute of Mathematics](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn), Nankai University, Tianjin and got my PhD degree in 2001.

I spent two years from 2001 to 2003 at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University as postdoc.

Then I joined Capital Normal University in 2003 as a faculty member of Department of Mathematics.

Here is my CV (to be added).

### [Research](https://shanzhong-sun.github.io/ShanzhongSUN/research)


My research interests lie at the crossroads of mathematics and physics, and I work on such topics as N-body problem in celestial mechanics, Fukaya category in symplectic topology, semiclassical trace formula and resurgence theory. 

More precisely, I am interested in 

* Symplectic Geometry and Symplectic Topology: symplectic reduction; Floer homologies and Fukaya categories; quiver varieties; cluster varieties; singularities from symplectic perspective

* Hamiltonian Systems and Celestial Mechanics: Maslov index; N-body problem (stability; central configurations; periodic orbits); Gutzwiller’s semiclassical trace formula; (algebraic) completely integrable Hamiltonian systems (ACIS) and their interactions with geometry and physics
 
* Mathematical Physics: higher structures (homological/homotopical algebras, higher categories,...) behind quantum mechanics and quantum field theory; quantization (semiclassical, deformation quantization, BV, brane quantization...); modularity; gauge theory; Feynman diagrams  

* Resurgence Theory and Mould Calculus à la Écalle with applications in mathematics (BCH, MZV, modularity...) and quantum physics (wall-crossing, Écalle-Voros exact WKB analysis, complex Chern-Simons theory, topological string theory...)

    > 题目：The two Levi-Civita regularizations 
    > 
    > 摘要：Levi-Civita published in 1916, and republished in 1920 and 1924, a proof that the flow of the 3-dimensional 3-body problem may be regularized, that is, replaced by a smooth flow which passes the binary collisions without experiencing any kind of singularity. This proof is reproduced by Siegel in his book (1956). But from 1965, all the authors on the reg- ularization of the binary collisions considered that Levi-Civita only did the 2-dimensional case, and that the 3-dimensional case was first proposed in 1964 by Kustaanheimo, who extended in a sophisticated way the 2-dimensional regularization that Levi-Civita used in 1906. This is extremely surprising. What is then the status of Levi-Civita’s result in 1916? He claimed to regularize the flow, without any hypothesis on the value of the energy. If we replace his second regularization by the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel regularization, we cannot regularize the binary collisions with zero energy. If we replace it by Moser’s regularization (1970), which indeed Moser relates to Levi-Civita’s second regularization (see [2] p. 615), we have the same problem. I will propose a very simple improvement of Levi-Civita’s second regularization which confirms his argument. The improved regularization is still simpler than the KS regularization.
